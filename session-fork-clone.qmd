## Existing repositories

All this course has been about you creating a new repository but what about collaboration with existing projects?

::: incremental
-   your own repository on a new computer (clone)
-   a repository from your team which you are a member (clone)
-   a repository from someone or somewhere that you don't have rights to change (fork)
:::

. . .

```{r}
usethis::create_from_github(repo_spec = "nhs-r-community/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions")
```

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Cloud specific folder structure

On Posit Cloud the project gets saved in \`Cloud\> home \> r99999 (similar) \> r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions
:::

## The benefits of {usethis}

Using the function `create_from_github()` means that it:

-   Automatically checks if this would be a clone or a fork!
-   Automatically goes to the main working directory, mine is in `C:/Users/zoe.turner`
-   Opens up a new RStudio session

## Clone (access) and Fork (no access)

Cloned message:

``` markdown
✔ Setting `fork = FALSE`
✔ Creating 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions/'
✔ Cloning repo from 'https://github.com/nhs-r-community/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions.git' into 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions'
✔ Setting active project to 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions'
ℹ Default branch is 'main'
✔ Opening 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/r4ds-ed2-exercise-solutions/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

. . .

Forked message (will also appear in your GitHub):

``` markdown
✔ Setting `fork = TRUE`
✔ Creating 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/nhspy-plotthedots/'
✔ Forking 'nhs-pycom/nhspy-plotthedots'
✔ Waiting for the fork to finalize before cloning
✔ Cloning repo from 'https://github.com/Lextuga007/nhspy-plotthedots.git' into 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/nhspy-plotthedots'
✔ Setting active project to 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/nhspy-plotthedots'
ℹ Default branch is 'main'
✔ Adding 'upstream' remote: 'https://github.com/nhs-pycom/nhspy-plotthedots.git'
✔ Pulling changes from 'upstream/main'.
✔ Setting remote tracking branch for local 'main' branch to 'upstream/main'
✔ Writing 'nhspy-plotthedots.Rproj'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Opening 'C:/Users/zoe.turner/nhspy-plotthedots/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

## Alternatives - Cloning in GitHub

Select the green button for `<> Code` and it will give you an option to clone

This course has used `https` and the copy button to the right takes the whole code

## Forking in GitHub - then needs Cloning!

`Fork` to your own repository and then `Clone` from there to your computer:

## In RStudio

With the copied HTTPS url, in RStudio you will need to start a new Project and use the third option (possibly ignored until now!) for versioning:

## Posit Cloud is already a project!

-   Creating a project on the Cloud isn't possible because **it is** a project
-   Even in RStudio it's not possible to put a project in another project.

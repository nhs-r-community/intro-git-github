## Check Git

Check if Git is already installed. Run the following in the *Terminal* (not the RStudio Console!)

```
which git
```

Check the version of your Git

```
git --version
```

If asked to install the Xcode command line tools, say yes!
Right click to copy on a Terminal line

## Downloading Git

- Download the installer from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
- Run keeping all the default settings. 

:::{.callout-note collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Installer hangs at 100%

If the installer hangs with the progress bar at 100%, close the installer with Task Manager (press `Ctrl + Alt + Delete`;  
select Task Manager;  
find Git for Windows installer and close).

## Connecting RStudio to Git

- Open RStudio
- In the menus go to `Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN`
- Check RStudio has found Git under "Git executable:" 

You may need to click `Browse` and find the Git executable

:::{.callout-note collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Where to find the git.exe
It may be under `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Git\` - remember if file extensions are hidden it will show as git rather than git.exe.  
Restart RStudio before trying to use git.

## GitHub

Register a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).

- Suggest to incorporate your actual name/reuse your username from other contexts (like Social Media)
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your boss
- Shorter is better
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible
- Make it timeless
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming
- Use all lower case letters

## Think about security

Particularly for GitHub and your own account safety 

Set up [2FA (two-factor authentication)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) using an app or save the generated code

## Install packages

The following packages are required for the course:

```{r}
install.packages("gert")
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("gitcreds")
```

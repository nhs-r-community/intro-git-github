## Snapshots

It's good to practice regular saving of files when you work - whatever the program

:::incremental
- But what if you want to take a snapshot before you do something major?
- You could save files as version 1, version 2 and so on 
- Git allows whole project snapshots of many documents
:::

## Not just for new material

Have you ever commented out code that you don't want to use but want to keep - just in case?

:::incremental
- Git allows things to be deleted and add a message as to why you did that
- Roll backs are also available!
- And if you want to find the old code but not roll back - Git has that history, it keeps everything
:::

## Local and Remote

Once you have a snapshot stored locally (Git) you can **push** the snapshot to a remote site (GitHub) 

This is like:

::: incremental
- sending file updates by email and also
- sharing on something like DropBox
:::

## An unnecessary extra step?

The tendency for much of analysis work is to share once something is finished

But **commits** (snapshots):

::: incremental
- allow others to contribute with your work in progress
- forces you to think clearly about code as others will see it
- give the opportunity to **revert** (roll back) to something that was better
:::

## Private or public repository?

GitHub offers the possibility of having private repositories

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
They have a few restrictions on functionality (unless in a paid account)
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Still should never have any identifiable information for security

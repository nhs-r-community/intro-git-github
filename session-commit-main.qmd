## Not recommended, but sometimes useful

The `pr_*` functions all relate to Pull Requests but it is possible to commit to main directly

Commit work using

```{r}
gert::git_commit_all("This is a message")

# or

gert::git_add("file.qmd")
gert::git_commit("This is a message")

```

and then use the `Push` button in the Git RStudio pane or in the Terminal ($)

```{bash}
git push
```

## Accidentally committed 

If you commit by accident to any branch, but particularly main, you can undo the last commit

You can undo any number of last commits!

This has to be done in the Terminal ($)

```{bash}
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

## End session
